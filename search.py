    2020 Generic search module for Python 3.5+
        
This search module is based on the AIMA book. 
http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/

Search (Chapters 3-4)

The way to use this code is to subclass the class 'Problem' to create 
your own class of problems,  then create problem instances and solve them with 
calls to the various search functions.
