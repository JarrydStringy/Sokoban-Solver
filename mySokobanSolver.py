    Sokoban assignment


The functions and classes defined in this module will be called by a marker script. 
You should complete the functions and classes according to their specified interfaces.

No partial marks will be awarded for functions that do not meet the specifications
of the interfaces.

You are NOT allowed to change the defined interfaces.
In other words, you must fully adhere to the specifications of the 
functions, their arguments and returned values.
Changing the interfacce of a function will likely result in a fail 
for the test of your code. This is not negotiable! 

You have to make sure that your code works with the files provided 
(search.py and sokoban.py) as your code will be tested 
with the original copies of these files.

- clarifiy some comments, rename some functions
  (and hopefully didn't introduce any bug!)
