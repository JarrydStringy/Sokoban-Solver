'''

This module defines utility functions and classes for a Sokoban assignment.

The main class is the Warehouse class.

An instance of this class can read a text file coding a Sokoban puzzle,
and  store information about the positions of the walls, boxes and targets 
list. See the header comment of the Warehouse class for details

class Warehouse:
    '''
    A Warehouse instance represents the initial configuration of a warehouse
    in a Sokoban puzzle. The information stored in a Warehouse instance 
    includes the position of the walls, targets, boxes and the worker.
    The attributes 'self.boxes', 'self.targets' and 'self.walls'
    are tuples of (x,y) coordinates (x <-> columns, y <-> rows).
    The attribute 'self.worker' is a tuple (x,y)
    The origin is at the top left. 
    The horizontal axis 'x' is pointing right.
    The vertical axis 'y' is pointing down.  
    The attributes  self.nrows and self.ncols are 
    the number of rows and cols of the warehouse.
    
    The attribute self.weights contains the weights of the boxes.
    If self.weights != None then self.weights[i] is the weight of the
    ith box. 
    
    The weights of the boxes are used in the computation of the cost
    of the pushing actions.
