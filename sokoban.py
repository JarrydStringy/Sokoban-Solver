"""

This module defines utility functions and classes for a Sokoban assignment.

The main class is the Warehouse class.

An instance of this class can read a text file coding a Sokoban puzzle,
and  store information about the positions of the walls, boxes and targets 
list. See the header comment of the Warehouse class for details
